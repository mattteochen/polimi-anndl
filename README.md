# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repo contains the group homework projects for the ANNDL course at [Politecnico di Milano](https://polimi.it). Proff: Boracchi, Matteucci.

The two homeworks for the academic year 2024/25 are:

- H1: Blood Cells Image Classification (final mark 5.5/5.5)
- H2: Mars Terrain Segmentation (final mark 5.0/5.5)

The datasets were provided by our TA and are not publicly available. For each homework find in the `deliverables` subfolder the corresponding report explaining our work.
The notebooks are runnable with minimum dependency requirements, a conda environment is given to replicate our settings, however some runs were done on external platforms such as kaggle.
